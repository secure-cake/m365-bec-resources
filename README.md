This is just a compilation of M365 "business email compromise" (BEC) investigative tools, notes, etc. M365 is in "constant development," so things change rapidly and, as usual, I'm a fan of simple, lightweight "tools" (scripts, whatever) that help me (you!) quickly, accessibly (meaning it's important we undertsand what any "tool" is doing!) answer investigative questions!
